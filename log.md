# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Dec 18, 2024

**Today's Progress**:
* Install Ubuntu
* Set up github for 100 Days of Code
* Set up Docker
* Start front-end web development exploration
  * Write a simple HTML/CSS
  * Write a simple interacion with Javascript/DOM
  * Use the nginx docker image to test the web page locally 
* Start writing a docker image for front-end web development

**Thoughts:** Docker is nice, but I struggled to find a way to directly access github from inside of a Docker container.

### Day 1: Dec 19, 2024

**Today's Progress**:
- Use Docker compose to streamline the process for dev/test/run
- Set up linters for automated building, testing and CI

**Thoughts:** Docker compose is useful. I think I'll eventually make public the repo I'm working on as a web app development template.

**Today's Progress**:
- Turned Javascript into TypeScript.

- Introduced vitest for TDD of front-end.

**Thoughts:** Trying to integrate tools manually to learn the tech stack. Takes a long time, but nice to get some knowledge.
