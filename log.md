# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Dec 18, 2024

**Today's Progress**:
* Install Ubuntu
* Set up github for 100 Days of Code
* Set up Docker
* Start front-end web development exploration
  * Write a simple HTML/CSS
  * Write a simple interacion with Javascript/DOM
  * Use the nginx docker image to test the web page locally 
* Start writing a docker image for front-end web development

**Thoughts:** Docker is nice, but I struggled to find a way to directly access github from inside of a Docker container.

### Day 1: Dec 19, 2024

**Today's Progress**:
- Use Docker compose to streamline the process for dev/test/run
- Set up linters for automated building, testing and CI

**Thoughts:** Docker compose is useful. I think I'll eventually make public the repo I'm working on as a web app development template.

### Day 2: Dec 20, 2024

**Today's Progress**:
- Turned Javascript into TypeScript.
- Set up tsc/webpack for easy deployment.
- Set up prettier for automatic prettification.
- Introduced vitest for TDD of front-end.

**Thoughts:** Trying to integrate tools manually to learn the tech stack. Takes a long time, but nice to get some knowledge.

### Day 3: Dec 21, 2024

**Today's Progress**:
- Searched and learned the currently popular web development frameworks and their pros and cons.

**Thoughts:** There are so many web front-end frameworks. I do not want to lock myself into a particular eco-system or vendor, so I'll stay flexible and open.

### Day 4: Dec 22, 2024

**Today's Progress**:
- Created another boilerplate with vite,React,mui
- Wrote a todo app with React
- Played with mui

**Thoughts:** create-vite can set up a boiler plate much quicker than combining tools myself. There are so many frameworks etc in the world of front-end dev.

### Day 5: Dec 23, 2024

**Today's Progress**:
- Continued the boilerplate for integrating vitest, testing-library
- Single place (in-file) testing
- Developed a simple photoframe app

**Thoughts:** Finally, the boilderplate for front-end apps is in a good shape. Nice to develop my own first front-end app.

### Day 6: Dec 24, 2024

**Today's Progress**:
- Made the photoframe app pseudo-full-screen
- Integrated thirdparty license generation mechanism

**Thoughts:** Strugging to find a auto doc generation tool from JSDoc.

### Day 7: Dec 25, 2024

**Today's Progress**:
- Refactored the photoframe app
- Integrated the documentation generation tool

**Thoughts:** There is not simple or lightweight end-to-end doc generation tool. I might write a json to HTML converter myself.

### Day 8: Jan 2, 2025

**Today's Progress**:
- Made a simple back-end app using Python django

**Thoughts:** Learned only the very basics. Frankly, I'm more intereted in graphics or hands on work rather than simply creating a small sample app.

### Day 9: Jan 3, 2025

**Today's Progress**:
- Tried out React Flow and learned its basics

**Thoughts:** React Flow seems pretty neet. Let's see how extensible it is.
